# Spring REST Docs Learning Tests

This project demonstrates how [Spring REST Docs](https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs/) can be used to document RESTful services.

To generate the documentation run the following command:

```
mvn install
```

The documentation will then be located in:

```
target/generated-docs/example.html
```
