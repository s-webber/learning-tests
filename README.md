# Learning Tests

I created this project to allow me to improve my understanding of common open-source libraries and frameworks.
The project uses unit tests to perform controlled experiments of third-party APIs.
I was inspired to use this approach by Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_<sup>1</sup>.
Jim Newkirk calls such tests _learning tests_<sup>2</sup>.

Learning tests provide a convenient mechanism for exploring an API in an isolated, incremental and reproducible way.
They also provide a demonstrably accurate form of documentation for future reference.

The aim of this project is to provide an introduction to various libraries and frameworks, rather than providing comprehensive test coverage of all their features.
