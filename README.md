# Learning Tests

I created this project to allow me to improve my understanding of common open-source libraries and frameworks.
The project uses unit tests to perform controlled experiments of third-party APIs.
I was inspired to use this approach by Robert C. Martin's _Clean Code_<sup>1</sup>.
Jim Newkirk calls such tests _learning tests_<sup>2</sup>.
