# Spring Boot Swagger Example

This project contains an example of integrating [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) with a [Spring Boot](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/) REST service.

To build and start the application:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the application is running you can use the Swagger documentation to interact with it by visiting:

```
http://localhost:8080/sdoc.jsp
```
